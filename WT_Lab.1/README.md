### Laboratory work implementation
During this laboratory I got familiar with Bootstrap framework. As a quick review I want to mention some important features of
Bootstrap, which make it one of the most popular framework for developing websites. Bootsrap helped me to create my website in a easier 
way. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates of different elements, as well as JavaScript plugins. The main advantage of Bootstrap 
is the ability to create responsive designs.

The home page of my website which may be loaded by openning _index.html_ represents a carousel through some images. Instead of text I 
choose some pictures which give to user or guest the information about what kind of website it is. Taking in account the requirements of 
this laboratory work I created a navigation bar, which will be on every other pages of the website. Why? Because I see this very 
comfortable, it doesn't matter on what page the user is, he or she will have the possiblity to navigate freely at any moment.

Also, I added some more pages such as _football.html_ and _aboutus.html_ in order to demonstrate that navigation works as expected and to
add some meaningfull content to my website. If you acces _aboutus page_ you will find the name of the website and below it the reason why
I choose this subject for my website. The above mentioned characteristics name and reason are placed in a such called jumbotron element in
order to call extra attention. Further I described the main directions and values of the website. In footer of the page there are some
details in which the user may be iterested such as: contacts, social networks and newsletter.

One more thing which I want to mention is grid systems I used while creating the above mentined pages. For different elements I used 
different column sizes. The advantage is that grid system of Bootstrap is responsive and the columns will re-arrange automatically 
depending on the screen size.

### Conclusion
Bootstrap is a very useful front-end framework for web development. It helps us to create responsive websites, which represent its main 
advantage. During this laboratory work I discovered a lot of new things while implementing the stuff which was required. This laboratory 
work was a good introudction to web development.
